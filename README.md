# bash-useful
Small scripts, functions, and utilities for bash/sh

Scripts/utilities end in `.sh` and can be run if set executable

Functions end in `.shf` and should be added to current shell with `source filename.shf`

- **administration/** contains scripts/functions useful for system administration
- **macos-tweaks/** contains settings and small tools to tweak MacOS behaviors; all scripts here are idempotent
